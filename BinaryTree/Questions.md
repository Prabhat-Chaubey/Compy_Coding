### Find Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree
**Explanation:**
You are given the root node of a binary tree. The goal is to calculate how "deep" the tree goes.
Depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to a leaf node.
- A tree with just one root node has depth 1.
- A tree with multiple layers of children has greater depth.
This question helps you understand how to traverse a tree to compute global properties like height or depth.
