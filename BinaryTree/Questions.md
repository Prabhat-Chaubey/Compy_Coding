### Question 1: Find Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree
**Explanation:**
You are given the root node of a binary tree. The goal is to calculate how "deep" the tree goes.
Depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to a leaf node.
- A tree with just one root node has depth 1.
- A tree with multiple layers of children has greater depth.

This question helps you understand how to traverse a tree to compute global properties like height or depth.

### Question 2: Check if a Binary Tree is Height Balanced
**Explanation:**
You are given a binary tree and asked to determine whether it is balanced.
A binary tree is considered height-balanced if:
- For every node in the tree, the difference in height between its left and right subtree is no more than 1.
- This condition must hold recursively at every node, not just the root.

This problem helps you practice recursion and teaches you to evaluate structural properties of subtrees.

### Question 3: Check if Two Binary Trees are Identical
**Explanation:**
You are given the root nodes of two binary trees.
You must check whether:
- Both trees have the same structure (i.e., same shape), and
- Corresponding nodes in both trees contain the same values.

This question focuses on tree comparison and recursive checking of structure + value equality at every level.

### Question 4: Convert a Binary Tree to its Mirror Tree
**Explanation:**
You are given the root of a binary tree and asked to transform it into its mirror image.
That means:
- For every node in the tree, swap its left and right child.
- The transformation should be done recursively or iteratively through the whole tree.

This problem is great for understanding tree modification, not just reading or querying.

### Question 5: Check if a Binary Tree is Symmetric
**Explanation:**
Youâ€™re asked to check if a binary tree is a mirror of itself, meaning:
- The left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.
- For example, if you folded the tree down the middle, both halves should match.

This is similar to checking if two trees are mirror images of each other, except the tree is comparing with itself.
