## DFS - (Depth First Search)
- Preorder
- Inorder
- PostOrder
![DFS Tree](https://github.com/Prabhat-Chaubey/Compy_Coding/blob/main/Untitled-2024aa-10-07-1413.png)
### Preorder
- Process the `Node` , then process the `left` the process the `Right`
- [1,2,4,5,3,10]

### Inorder
- Process the `left` , then process the `Node` the process the `Right`
- [4,2,5,1,10,3]

### Postorder
- Process the `Left` , then process the `Right` the process the `Node`
- [4,5,2,10,3,1]


## BFS - (Breadth First Search)
 - We travel the breadth wise
 - [1,2,3,4,5,10]
---
#### We use Stack for DFS
#### We use Queue for BFS
---
## Binary Search Tree
- The Binary Search tree is a tree when all the left side is smaller than the node and right side is greater than the node.
